Some recommended features and plugins for Eclipse:
- Web Tools Platform
- subclipse (subversion repositories)
- egit (git repositories)
- Apache Derby Core plugin (e.g. 10.8.2.2)

Setup
- go in project properties > java build path > libraries 
  and configure Eclipse to use your system JRE libraries 
  (remove the default set by the files from the Git repository and add your system's JRE libraries)
