Install
On a Linux workstation (e.g. Mint), install Tomcat7 and java dependencies.
This app relies on Tomcat7 and the latest servlet APIs to handle file uploads.

(The Webcontent folder will be renamed TOPS and dropped into Tomcat's webapps folder, with classes compiled. Or use Eclipse that will compile the project for you.)

Testing
1) Launch Tomcat (e.g. from Eclipse)
2) Check http://localhost:8080/TOPS/   
3) Login with the credentials you defined in setup-db.sql (default for user admin is yourpassword).
